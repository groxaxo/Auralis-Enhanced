# 🎉 Gradio Interface V2 - Improvements Implemented

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Text Generation Caching Issue** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: After one generation, subsequent generations produced the same output regardless of new text input.

**Solution**: 
- Added unique `request_id` for each generation using `uuid.uuid4().hex`
- Forces the TTS engine to treat each request as unique
- Prevents caching of previous results

```python
request_id = uuid.uuid4().hex
request = TTSRequest(
    text=input_text,
    # ... other params
    request_id=request_id  # Force unique request
)
```

### 2. **Audio Not Saved** ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Generated audio was not being saved to disk.

**Solution**:
- All generated audio is now automatically saved to `/home/op/Auralis/generated_audio/`
- Filenames include timestamp and request ID: `argentinian_tts_20251015_014530_abc12345.wav`
- File path is displayed in the UI after generation
- Uses proper WAV format with torchaudio

### 3. **Voice Library System** ✅ NEW FEATURE
**Problem**: Users had to re-upload reference audio every time.

**Solution**:
- **Voice Library**: Save and reuse voices across sessions
- **Dropdown Menu**: Select from saved voices instead of re-uploading
- **Persistent Storage**: Voices stored in `/home/op/Auralis/voice_library/`
- **Metadata System**: JSON file tracks all saved voices with creation dates

## 🔍 Technical Improvements

### State Management
- Unique request IDs prevent caching
- Proper Gradio state updates
- No stale data between generations

### Audio Processing
```python
# Proper int16 conversion
if audio_array.dtype == np.float16 or audio_array.dtype == np.float32:
    if audio_array.max() > 1.0 or audio_array.min() < -1.0:
        audio_array = audio_array / np.abs(audio_array).max()
    audio_array = (audio_array * 32767).astype(np.int16)
```

### File Management
- Automatic directory creation
- Organized file structure
- Timestamped filenames
- Persistent metadata storage

### Voice Library System
```python
# Voice metadata structure
{
  "Maria": {
    "files": ["/path/to/sample_0.wav", "/path/to/sample_1.wav"],
    "created": "2025-10-15T01:45:30.123456",
    "num_samples": 2
  }
}
```
